IntersectionTester is a small library that focuses on testing intersections between 2 primitive data types.

We aim to ease the user into testing these by using one simple query amonst all the datapoints isIntersecting()?

For this version, we can test points, linesegments, triangles, circles and squares.

The code also comes with a piece of GUI to provde analysis and use cases for the library.
